This is the Matlab vision

run from ./code/DZZimages.m

for now the result is not good, will be updated!

This is the Matlab vision

clean up the code:
displayOutput.m -- display the 3D model\curvature

DZZimages.m -- main file without light correct

getImages.m -- read in images

getNormalVec.m -- calculate the normal-vectors and reflect rate of surface

getSurface.m -- Compute height from normal-vectors

plotSurfaceNormals.m -- display the normal-vectors

preprocess.m -- cut the ROI, Threshold segmentation determines the processing area

splitScans.m -- split image from scan camera

surfcurvature.m -- calculate the curvature from height

surfcurvature2.m --calculate the curvature from normal-vectors

for now the result is not good, will be updated!

the code:
lightCorrect.m -- correct the light

DZZimage2.m -- main file with light correct

for now the result is better, will be updated!
